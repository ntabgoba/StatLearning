Principal Components
====================
We will use the `USArrests` data (which is in R)
```{r}
dimnames(USArrests)
apply(USArrests,2,mean)
apply(USArrests,2, var)
```

We see that `Assault` has a much larger variance than the other variables. It would dominate the principal components, so we choose to standardize the variables when we perform PCA

```{r}
pca.out=prcomp(USArrests, scale=TRUE)
pca.out
names(pca.out)
biplot(pca.out, scale=0)
```
